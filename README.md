Shopify evaluates apps based on four core principles:

| Principle      | What It Means                                                    |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Usefulness** | App delivers clear value, reflected in installs and positive reviews. |
| **User Experience** | Easy to use, intuitive, and accessible for all merchants.         |
| **Performance** | Runs efficiently for merchants and their customers.             |
| **Integration** | Meets category-specific standards so data flows to the right places.
